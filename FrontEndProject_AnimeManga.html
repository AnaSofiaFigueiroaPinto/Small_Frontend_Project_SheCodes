        In Japan the term <strong><em>anime</em></strong> is used to refer to
        all animation, much like cartoon is in English. Only elsewhere has anime
        become the term associated exclusively with animation from Japan. There
        is some debate over whether the term anime can be given to animation not
        from Japan. Although it technically can, anime has, at least in the
        English language, become synonymous with Japan. Anime has visually
        distinct features for characters, and deliberately uses a limited style
        for depicting movement. In the West, most animations are cartoons used
        to tell children stories, whereas anime often involves complex
        storylines and characters with adult themes.

    <p align="justify">
        <strong><em>Manga</em></strong> are comic books rather than animations.
        Unlike anime, manga is often published in black and white. Why? Because
        they are usually published weekly and printing them in colour would take
        too much time and money. Manga is usually fairly cheap to publish and
        only requires a small number of artists to produce. In fact it can take
        just one, the mangaka, who is usually both the author and illustrator,
        as well as filling in other roles of the publishing process.
